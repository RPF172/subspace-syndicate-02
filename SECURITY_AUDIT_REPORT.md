# Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This security audit was performed on a React/TypeScript application using Supabase as the backend. The application appears to be a social media platform with video sharing, messaging, and user management features. 

**Overall Risk Level: HIGH**

## Critical Security Vulnerabilities

### 1. Hardcoded Sensitive Credentials (CRITICAL)
**File:** `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`
**Lines:** 5-6

```typescript
const SUPABASE_URL = "https://bggqlewmggcpzhogdkrn.supabase.co";
const SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImJnZ3FsZXdtZ2djcHpob2dka3JuIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTI1NDkzMDIsImV4cCI6MjA2ODEyNTMwMn0.4e9jC5JLueY8cKy-QPg8lMN3dsEPFF6hSK3fvDSxwrQ";
```

**Risk:** The Supabase credentials are hardcoded in the source code instead of using environment variables.
**Impact:** Credentials are exposed in the client-side code and version control.
**Recommendation:** Move these to environment variables (`VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`).

### 2. XSS Vulnerability - dangerouslySetInnerHTML (HIGH)
**File:** `src/components/ui/chart.tsx`
**Line:** 78

```typescript
dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
  __html: Object.entries(THEMES)
    .map(
      ([theme, prefix]) => `
${prefix} [data-chart=${id}] {
${colorConfig
  .map(([key, itemConfig]) => {
```

**Risk:** Using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without proper sanitization.
**Impact:** Potential XSS attacks if user input reaches this code.
**Recommendation:** Use a proper CSS-in-JS solution or sanitize the HTML content.

### 3. Overly Permissive CORS Configuration (MEDIUM)
**File:** `supabase/functions/create-media-bucket/index.ts`
**Lines:** 4-7

```typescript
const corsHeaders = {
  'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
  'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'authorization, x-client-info, apikey, content-type',
};
```

**Risk:** Wildcard CORS allows any domain to make requests.
**Impact:** Potential for CSRF attacks and unauthorized API access.
**Recommendation:** Restrict to specific domains in production.

### 4. Insufficient Admin Authorization Checks (HIGH)
**File:** `src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx`
**Lines:** 18-23

The admin check only validates against a `profiles.is_admin` field without proper server-side verification.

**Risk:** Client-side admin validation can be bypassed.
**Impact:** Potential privilege escalation.
**Recommendation:** Implement server-side admin validation in RLS policies.

## Security Issues

### 5. Weak Password Requirements (MEDIUM)
**Files:** 
- `src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx` (Line 14)
- `src/components/auth/SignupForm.tsx` (Line 13)

```typescript
password: z.string().min(6, { message: 'Password must be at least 6 characters' }),
```

**Risk:** Minimum password length of 6 characters is too weak.
**Impact:** Vulnerable to brute force attacks.
**Recommendation:** Increase to 8+ characters and add complexity requirements.

### 6. Missing Environment Variable Protection (MEDIUM)
**File:** `.gitignore`

Missing `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.production` files in gitignore.

**Risk:** Environment files could be accidentally committed.
**Impact:** Credential exposure.
**Recommendation:** Add comprehensive environment file patterns to `.gitignore`.

### 7. File Upload Security Issues (HIGH)
**File:** `src/components/video/VideoUploadForm.tsx`
**Lines:** 87-92

```typescript
if (!['video/mp4', 'video/quicktime', 'video/avi', 'video/x-msvideo'].includes(file.type)) {
```

**Risk:** File type validation only checks MIME type, which can be spoofed.
**Impact:** Malicious file uploads.
**Recommendation:** Add server-side file validation and scan uploaded files.

### 8. Insecure File Size Limits (MEDIUM)
**File:** `supabase/functions/create-media-bucket/index.ts`
**Line:** 67

```typescript
fileSizeLimit: 50 * 1024 * 1024, // 50MB limit
```

**Risk:** Large file uploads could be used for DoS attacks.
**Impact:** Resource exhaustion.
**Recommendation:** Implement rate limiting and user-specific quotas.

## Bugs and Code Quality Issues

### 9. Missing Key Props in Map Functions (LOW)
Multiple files contain `.map()` calls without proper `key` props, which can cause React rendering issues.

**Files:** Multiple (grep search found 150+ instances)
**Impact:** Performance issues and potential rendering bugs.
**Recommendation:** Add unique `key` props to all mapped elements.

### 10. Inconsistent Error Handling (MEDIUM)
**File:** `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

Error handling is inconsistent across authentication functions.

**Impact:** Poor user experience and potential information leakage.
**Recommendation:** Implement consistent error handling patterns.

### 11. Memory Leaks in Event Listeners (LOW)
**File:** `src/components/video/VideoUploadForm.tsx`
**Lines:** 70-73

Event listeners are properly cleaned up, but some other components may have memory leaks.

**Impact:** Performance degradation.
**Recommendation:** Audit all event listener usage for proper cleanup.

## UI/UX Issues

### 12. Accessibility Issues (MEDIUM)
- Missing ARIA labels on interactive elements
- Poor keyboard navigation support
- Insufficient color contrast in some areas

**Impact:** Poor accessibility for users with disabilities.
**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive accessibility testing and fixes.

### 13. Loading State Inconsistencies (LOW)
Different loading indicators used across the application without consistent patterns.

**Impact:** Poor user experience.
**Recommendation:** Standardize loading states and indicators.

### 14. Form Validation UX (LOW)
**File:** `src/components/auth/SignupForm.tsx`

Form validation messages could be more user-friendly.

**Impact:** User confusion during registration.
**Recommendation:** Improve validation messages and real-time feedback.

## Infrastructure Security

### 15. Security Headers Configuration (GOOD)
**File:** `netlify.toml`
**Lines:** 13-20

Good security headers are configured:
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

**Recommendation:** Consider adding Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.

## Database Security

### 16. Row Level Security (RLS) Policies
The application uses Supabase RLS policies, but they need review to ensure proper authorization.

**Risk:** Potential data exposure if RLS policies are misconfigured.
**Recommendation:** Audit all RLS policies for proper authorization checks.

## Recommendations Priority

### Immediate (Critical)
1. Move hardcoded credentials to environment variables
2. Fix XSS vulnerability in chart component
3. Implement proper server-side admin authorization
4. Add comprehensive file upload validation

### Short Term (High Priority)
1. Strengthen password requirements
2. Restrict CORS origins for production
3. Add environment files to .gitignore
4. Implement rate limiting for uploads

### Medium Term
1. Fix React key prop issues
2. Improve error handling consistency
3. Enhance accessibility
4. Add CSP headers

### Long Term
1. Implement comprehensive security testing
2. Add automated security scanning to CI/CD
3. Regular security audits
4. User security training

## Compliance Considerations

If this application handles personal data, ensure compliance with:
- GDPR (if serving EU users)
- CCPA (if serving California users)
- Other relevant data protection regulations

## Conclusion

The application has several critical security vulnerabilities that need immediate attention, particularly around credential management and authentication. The codebase shows good practices in some areas (security headers, authentication framework) but needs improvements in others. Regular security audits and automated scanning should be implemented to maintain security posture.

**Next Steps:**
1. Prioritize fixing critical vulnerabilities
2. Implement security testing in CI/CD pipeline
3. Establish regular security review processes
4. Consider engaging a professional security firm for deeper testing
